# Scrolling-Text-On-LED-Matrix
This repository is about creating a scrolling text on a 8x8 LED Matrix with Arduino. The user gives an input text through Serial Monitor from Arduino IDE and the Arduino will display the text on a 1588 8x8 LED Matrix.

## Components

✔ Arduino Uno

✔ 1588 8x8 LED Matrix

✔ 16 jumper wires

Here is a demonstration on how it will look like:
